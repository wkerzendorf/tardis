******************
Developer Workflow
******************

Many of the Development workflow is taken from `Astropy <http://docs.astropy.org
/en/stable/development/workflow/development_workflow.html>`_ and credit belongs
to the Astropy team for designing it.

The first step is to setup up a python environemnt. :doc:`python_environment`
explains how to do that.

:doc:`git_workflow` describes how to interact with git and github in the development
 of TARDIS.
